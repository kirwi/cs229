Homework problems from set 1 of Andrew Ng's Stanford Machine Learning
course, cs229. No solutions or libraries other than numpy, scipy, 
matplotlib, etc were used.

Problem 1 is a hand-written algorithm for recursive Newton-Raphson method
of regression on a data set with only two target values. Since there are
only two features, the decision boundary is a straight line which was 
calculated and plotted with matplotlib along with the data points.

Problem 2 is an exercise in weighted regression of a data set using various
valuse of "tau," a parameter that tunes the density of neighboring points
used for calculating the weights.
